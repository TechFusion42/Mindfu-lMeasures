            <h1>What is mindfulness?</h1>
            <p>
                Mindfulness is a mental state characterized by focusing one's awareness on the present moment while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, bodily sensations, and surroundings. It involves paying deliberate attention to experiences without judgment.</p>
